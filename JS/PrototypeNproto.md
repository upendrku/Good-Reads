**prototype** and \***\*proto\*\*** are both properties of objects in JavaScript, but they have different purposes.

- **prototype** is a property of a function object that points to the prototype of the objects created by that function. The prototype of an object is a blueprint for that object, and it contains all of the properties and methods that are shared by all objects of that type.
- \***\*proto\*\*** is an internal property of an object that points to the prototype of the object's constructor function. This property is not accessible to JavaScript code, but it is used by the JavaScript engine to implement inheritance.

In other words, **prototype** is a public property that can be accessed by JavaScript code, while \***\*proto\*\*** is an internal property that is used by the JavaScript engine.

Here is an example of how **prototype** and \***\*proto\*\*** are used:

```javascript
function Person() {}

Person.prototype.name = 'John Doe'

const john = new Person()

console.log(john.name) // "John Doe"
console.log(john.__proto__ === Person.prototype) // true
```

In this example, the `name` property is defined on the `Person.prototype` object. When the `new` keyword is used to create a new `Person` object, the `prototype` property of the new object is set to the `Person.prototype` object. This means that the `name` property is inherited by the new object.

The `__proto__` property of the new object is also set to the `Person.prototype` object, but this property is not accessible to JavaScript code. The JavaScript engine uses the `__proto__` property to implement inheritance.
