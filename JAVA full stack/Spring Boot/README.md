# Java Fullstack Developer Interview Preparation

This `README.md` file contains notes and answers to common interview questions for the role of Java Fullstack Developer, focusing on Spring Boot, Dependency Injection, Spring MVC, Spring Data, and connecting to databases.

## Topics to Study

### Basics of Spring Boot

- Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies the development of Java applications.
- It provides auto-configuration, opinionated defaults, and standalone deployment.
- Starters are dependencies that help set up a Spring Boot project with pre-configured defaults.

### Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring Boot

- Dependency Injection is a design pattern that allows the separation of object creation and usage.
- Spring Boot uses DI to manage dependencies and facilitate loose coupling.
- DI can be achieved through constructor injection, setter injection, or field injection.

### Spring MVC

- Spring MVC is a web framework that helps build web applications using the Model-View-Controller pattern.
- Key components include controllers, views, and models.
- Spring MVC provides annotation-based programming for request mapping, form handling, and error handling.

### Spring Data

- Spring Data simplifies database access and manipulation.
- It provides a consistent API for working with different data stores, such as relational databases or MongoDB.
- Spring Data JPA is used for relational databases, while Spring Data MongoDB is used for MongoDB.

### Advantages of Spring Boot

- Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code and configuration.
- It offers embedded servers, production-ready features, and robust security.
- Spring Boot has a large community and supports integration with other frameworks and technologies.

### Configuring the Server in Spring Boot

- Spring Boot provides an embedded server (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.) by default.
- The server configuration can be customized in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
- Properties such as port number, context path, and SSL settings can be modified.

### Connecting to Different Databases like MongoDB

- Spring Boot simplifies database connectivity.
- The database properties are configured in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
- To connect to MongoDB, Spring Boot can use the Spring Data MongoDB module.

## Sample Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is Spring Boot? How does it differ from the traditional Spring Framework?**

   - Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies Java application development by providing defaults and convention-over-configuration.
   - Unlike the traditional Spring Framework, Spring Boot eliminates much of the manual configuration required.

2. **What is dependency injection, and how is it implemented in Spring Boot?**

   - Dependency Injection is a design pattern where the dependencies of an object are injected rather than created within the object itself.
   - In Spring Boot, dependency injection is achieved using annotations like `@Autowired` or constructor injection.

3. **Explain the concept of auto-configuration in Spring Boot.**

   - Auto-configuration is a feature of Spring Boot that automatically configures beans based on the project's classpath and configured dependencies.
   - It simplifies the setup process by providing sensible defaults and reducing manual configuration.

4. **How does Spring Boot simplify the development and deployment of web applications?**

   - Spring Boot provides an embedded server by default, eliminating the need for separate server configuration.
   - It offers auto-configuration and starter dependencies for common web technologies, reducing manual setup.

5. **What is Spring MVC, and what are its key components?**

   - Spring MVC is a web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller pattern.
   - Key components include controllers (handling requests), views (generating responses), and models (data handling).

6. **How does Spring Boot handle form submissions and validations?**

   - Spring Boot provides annotations like `@PostMapping` to handle form submissions.
   - Validation can be achieved using validation annotations like `@Valid` and `@NotBlank` on form fields.

7. **What is Spring Data, and how does it simplify database access?**

   - Spring Data is a subproject of Spring that simplifies database access by providing a consistent and easy-to-use API.
   - It generates boilerplate code for common database operations, reducing development effort.

8. **How would you configure a different embedded server in a Spring Boot application?**

   - The embedded server can be configured in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file by setting server-specific properties such as port number or context path.

9. **How do you connect a Spring Boot application to a MongoDB database using Spring Data MongoDB?**

   - Configure the MongoDB connection details in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
   - Use Spring Data MongoDB annotations like `@Document` and `@Field` to define entities and their mappings.

10. **What are the advantages of using Spring Boot for application development?**
    - Spring Boot reduces manual configuration, leading to faster development.
    - It provides built-in features like auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready metrics and security.
